# About
Async Streams is the new feature in C# 8.0 which provides async support for handling streams or IEnumerable data. In this session we cover all the aspects of Async Streams (IAsyncEnumerable) including how to use ConfigureAwait and how to use CancellationToken as well. Cancellation token can be a great way to manage async programming in dotnet core and C# but with Async Streams it can be a bit difficult and at times if not used properly can give errors. We shall be discussing briefly everything about AsyncStreams.

IAsyncEnumerable also has options and support for CancellationToken as well as ConfigureAwait.
We also cover the the basic concepts and understanding on how and where it can be used
